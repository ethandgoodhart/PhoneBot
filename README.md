If you want to just be able to talk to PhoneBot without it being able to hear sounds from inside your computer, skip to the **How to run section**. But if you want to make PhoneBot able to hear sounds coming from inside the computer such as hearing someone talk on a FaceTime, make sure to follow these steps:
1. Install **BlackHole audio routing**: https://github.com/ethandgoodhart/PhoneBot/raw/master/BlackHole.v0.2.6.pkg
2. Go to *System Preferences > Sound* and click on *Input*; Make sure that **BlackHole 16ch** is selected
3. Open up the **Audio MIDI Setup app**, and click on the small plus in the bottom left corner
4. Click on Create **Multi-Output Device**, then make sure that **Built-in Output** and **BlackHole 16ch** are both selected
5. Lastly, go back to *System Preferences > Sound* and click on *Output*; Select **Multi-Output Device** and you are ready to go!<br/><br/>
